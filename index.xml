      <description>12:08 PM, 10 minutes before USACO February ends. I still have a 0 as my score. I probably could&amp;rsquo;ve gotten some partial credits if I wanted to, but what&amp;rsquo;s the point? I&amp;rsquo;d rather get a dignified zero than some embarrassing two-digit score. With that mindset, I spent three hours trying to solve the first problem. There are a few points when I felt that I solved the problem, that I have broken through, but there were always some tiny cases when my algorithm wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

      <description>Second day of 2022. Hooray time to spread some negativity!
I suck. At competitive programming. At math. At writing fucking essays. I suck at keeping my promises. I suck at sticking to my todo lists.
I am lonely. I want love.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought that life will get better as I grow up. Bad habits will fade away. Looks like I&amp;rsquo;m wrong, huh?
Life is almost repetitive.
while (alive) { wakeup() suffer() go_to_sleep_thinking_something_will_change_tomorrow() } I hope something will change tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement (CF 1615 E) Given a tree with root $1$ and $N$ nodes, there are two players Red and Blue. Red can perform the following operation: pick a subtree and color all its nodes red. However, the total number of red nodes cannot exceed $K$. After Red performs his operation, Blue can also pick a subtree, as long as it does not contain a red node, and color all of its nodes blue.</description>

      <description>Recently, I got a mp3 player from my dad so that I can listen to music in bed without using any devices that could potentially be distracting. However, most of the music on the mp3 player don&amp;rsquo;t particularly fit my taste, so I want to download my own Christmas playlist.
But my dad refused to tell me how he pirates his music. Now in the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this command-line tool youtube-dl to download youtube videos and convert them to mp3.</description>

      <description>FINALLY THE MOST EPIC PLAYLIST WAS BORN!!!
I&amp;rsquo;ve long been planning to make a playlist that contains all the music that I like. Now, it is here. Note that this playlist mainly contains classic rock, post rock, folk, dream pop/shoegaze, hip-hop and pop. Most metal songs are not included because I will make a separate playlist for them. Enjoy!</description>

      <description>$\text{Feliz Navidad Amigos!}$
The long-awaited Christmas break has finally arrived. No need to wake up at 6:30 or finish the boring data structure homework anymore. YES. That being said, I also don&amp;rsquo;t want my break to be me pointlessly surfing the Internet and wasting time. This break is meant to be a time to rest, be productive and explore new interests. Therefore, I decided to create the following list of goals:</description>

      <description>This is a personal blog. Although I hope the readers (who knows? Maybe the blog will blow up one day) can take away a lot from reading my posts, the main purpose of the blog is to document my observations, opinions and growths. As of right now, the blog will be mainly on computer science, math, life in general, my takeaways on current events, and music/book reviews.</description>
